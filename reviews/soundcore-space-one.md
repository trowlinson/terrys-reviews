## 🎧 Soundcore Space One

Amazing noise-cancelling headphones with superb comfort and sound quality.

I didn't think I'd like these as much as I do. I was going to spend a lot of money on some Bose or Sony headphones and sure they might be better but for the money these are fantastic. Light, comfortable, good sound - I'm not an audiophile so don't complain that it's a little light on the mid range or whatever someone who knows about these things may compain about - they sound perfectly fine to my ears. And they handle high volumes too. No rattle and hum here. I used them on the flight from the UK to New Zealand, with a cable and adapter not wireless, and I could wear them for a number of hours without any major discomfort. They can push the glasses arms on to the back of the ears so that is one thing to watch if you have to wear glasses. 

Android App gives control of EQ settings, firmware updates, and a few other bits and pieces. There is also a soft carry case that comes with them, but if you time it right in a sale, you can sometimes get the hardcase thrown in for free (YMMV)
