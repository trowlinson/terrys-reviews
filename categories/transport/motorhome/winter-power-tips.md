## 🔋 Battery Basics

- **Charge fully before you set off** – Cold weather drains batteries faster.
- **Check your leisure battery health** – Older batteries struggle in low temps.
- **Use hook-up when possible** – Keeps everything topped up and stress-free.
- **Solar panels still work** – But expect less output on short, cloudy days.

💡 *Tip: Turn off unused lights and devices to stretch your battery life.*

## ❄️ Heating Without Panic

- **Use your onboard heating wisely** – Gas heating is great off-grid, but check your bottle levels.
- **Electric fan heaters** – Handy on hook-up, but don’t overload the circuit.
- **Thermal blinds or screens** – Keep warmth in and condensation out.
- **Hot water bottles** – Old-school, but brilliant.

## 🧤 Cold-Weather Comfort

- **LED lights** – Low power draw and warm glow.
- **Charge phones during the day** – Don’t leave it to bedtime when power’s low.
- **Use a USB hub** – Efficient charging for multiple devices.
- **Keep torches handy** – Just in case.

## 🧪 Practical Tips

- **Keep your water pump off overnight** – Prevents freezing and saves power.
- **Open cupboard doors** – Helps warm air circulate and prevents damp.
- **Use a moisture trap or dehumidifier** – Reduces condensation and protects electrics.
- **Check your fridge settings** – Some switch automatically between gas and electric.
