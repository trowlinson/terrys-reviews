🚐 Disneyland Paris Motorhome Parking - late 2025

🅿️ Parking & Access

* Follow the **coach signs** after the ticket barriers; the motorhome area is off a small roundabout.
* Mostly covered spaces, with a few open-air spots (handy for solar).
* Secure fencing, barriers, and one pedestrian gate.
* About a **1-mile walk** to the park entrance, half on moving walkways.

💶 Costs & Payment

* Standard rate: **€40/night**
* With an **Annual Pass**: **€15/night**
* Pay at the **luggage storage office** (cash only, show your pass) or at the **exit barrier** (card).
* Staff seemed unsure of the current system—signage may be outdated.
* Must leave before **10am**

🚰 Service Point

* Located ~800m away, past the roundabout.
* Offers fresh water, grey waste, and drain flush.
* Winter closures possible due to freezing—check before relying on it.
* Tip: Use the service point **before entering** the parking area.

🌙 Overnight Experience

* Some guests run engines or small generators for warmth in winter.
* Nearby: dog kennels, toilets (400m), and an **Esso station with LPG**

🛍️ Shopping & Extras

* **Val d’Europe mall** isn’t motorhome-friendly (tight spaces, height barriers).
* Free shuttle buses run from the train/bus station at the park entrance.

✅ Takeaway

Convenient, secure, and close to the park—but expect quirks with payment and service point access. With a full water tank and a spare toilet cassette, **3–4 days can be comfortably achieved**.
