## ❌ Failures (We’ve Made Them Too)

- **Pitch orientation panic** – Realized we were nose-in when everyone else was door-to-door.
- **Forgotten essentials** – No loo roll, no levellers, no kettle. All on the same trip.
- **Outside lights left on** – All night. Sorry, neighbours.
- **Overloaded electrics** – Tripped the site’s power with a kettle + heater combo.
- **Awning chaos** – Set it up in wind. Took it down in rain. Regret both.
- **Dog escape artist** – Forgot to zip the awning. Cue the chase.

## ✅ Successes Worth Repeating

- **Arrival checklist** – Saved us from forgetting chocks, keys, or switching the fridge.
- **Pitch-friendly layout** – Door facing the view, awning catching the breeze.
- **Meal prep magic** – Pre-chopped veg and frozen sauces = campsite gourmet.
- **Neighbourly vibes** – A wave, a chat, and a borrowed mallet go a long way.
- **Dog-friendly routines** – Lead hooks, paw wipes, and shaded spots for snoozing.
- **Weather-wise packing** – Layers, waterproofs, and a backup plan for every forecast.
- **Site reviews** – Left honest feedback to help the next traveller (and future us).

## 🧠 What We’d Tell Our Past Selves

- Don’t rush setup — it’s not a race.
- Always check pitch slope before committing.
- Bring more pegs. You’ll need them.
- Trust your gut on site vibes.
- Keep a “go bag” for late-night loo trips.
