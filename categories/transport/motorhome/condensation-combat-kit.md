## 💧 Why Condensation Happens

Warm air meets cold surfaces — and boom, moisture. In a motorhome, it’s most common on windows, walls, and inside cupboards. Left unchecked, it leads to damp smells, mould, and soggy bedding.

## 🧰 Your Condensation Combat Kit

These are the tools we actually use — no wiring, no fuss.

### 🧼 Daily Tools

- **Microfibre cloths** – Quick wipe-downs every morning.
- **Window squeegee** – For fast removal on large panes.
- **Moisture traps** – Passive dehumidifiers for cupboards and corners.
- **Ventilation** – Crack a window or roof vent, even in winter.

### 🧤 Insulation Helpers

- **Thermal blinds or screens** – Reduces cold surface contact.
- **Silver bubble wrap (DIY screens)** – Cheap and effective behind curtains.
- **Draft excluders** – Keep cold air from creeping in under doors.

### 🧪 Smart Habits

- **Cook with lids on** – Reduces steam.
- **Wipe down shower/toilet area after use** – Don’t let moisture linger.
- **Open cupboard doors** – Helps air circulate.
- **Don’t dry clothes inside** – Use site facilities or hang outside if possible.
