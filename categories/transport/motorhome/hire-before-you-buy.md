## 🚐 Why Hiring First Makes Sense

Buying a motorhome is a big investment — and it’s easy to get it wrong. Hiring lets you test different layouts, sizes, and features in the real world before you commit. You’ll quickly learn what matters most to you (and what doesn’t).

## 🧪 What You’ll Learn by Hiring

- **Driving comfort** – Are you happy behind the wheel of a 7.5m coachbuilt, or do you prefer a compact van?
- **Layout preferences** – Fixed bed vs. make-up bed? Rear lounge or front dinette?
- **Storage needs** – Do you need a garage for bikes, or are overhead lockers enough?
- **Power setup** – Are you okay with hook-ups only, or do you need solar and leisure batteries?
- **Daily routines** – How do you cook, wash, sleep, and relax in the space?
