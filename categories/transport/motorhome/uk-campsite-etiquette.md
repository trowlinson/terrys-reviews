## 🤝 Arrival & Setup

- **Check in properly** – Even at CLs, let someone know you’ve arrived.
- **Stick to your pitch** – Don’t sprawl into someone else’s space.
- **Face the right way** – Some sites have a “nose in” or “door to door” convention.
- **Keep noise down during setup** – No one loves a 7am hammering session.

---

## 🔇 Noise & Privacy

- **Quiet hours** – Most sites expect silence between 10pm–7am.
- **Music & TV** – Keep it low, or use headphones.
- **Respect boundaries** – Don’t walk across other pitches, even if it’s a shortcut.
- **Dogs** – Keep them on leads and clean up after them.

---

## 🚿 Shared Facilities

- **Leave it clean** – Wipe down sinks, mop shower floors if needed.
- **Don’t hog the block** – Be quick, especially in busy times.
- **Use your own loo if possible** – Helps reduce pressure on shared facilities.

---

## 🗑️ Waste & Water

- **Sort your rubbish** – Many sites expect recycling.
- **Empty cassettes discreetly** – Use designated points, rinse well, and don’t linger.
- **Don’t drain grey water on grass** – Use a container or drive-over grid.

---

## 🚗 Driving & Parking

- **Drive slowly** – 5mph is standard; kids and dogs are everywhere.
- **Park considerately** – Don’t block access or views.
- **Avoid engine idling** – Especially early morning or late evening.

---

## 🧭 General Good Vibes

- **Say hello** – A smile or wave goes a long way.
- **Offer help if needed** – Especially to new campers or solo travellers.
- **Respect site rules** – Even if they seem quirky.
- **Leave no trace** – Leave your pitch cleaner than you found it.

---

## 💬 Common Mistakes (We’ve Made Them Too)

- Forgetting to check pitch orientation
- Leaving outside lights on all night
- Playing music during someone else’s nap time
