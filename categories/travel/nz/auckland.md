## 🏙️ Auckland: A Love-Hate Letter to the Big Smoke

Once you’ve seen one bit of Auckland, you might think you’ve seen it all — traffic, sprawl, and a skyline that’s always under construction. Having lived there and commuted from the North Shore to Manukau (yes, worse than London), I’ve earned the right to grumble. But here’s the thing: Auckland is still a great city. It’s messy, sure, but it’s also vibrant, diverse, and full of places worth rediscovering.

They say the city’s transport is improving — light rail, more buses, bike lanes — and one day I’ll go back and see what’s changed. Until then, here’s what makes Auckland worth a day (or more).

## 🚍 Getting Around

Auckland’s public transport has long been a sore point, but things are changing. The **City Rail Link** is under construction, and there’s been a push for more frequent buses, ferries, and bike infrastructure. If you’re visiting, grab an **AT HOP card** for easy travel on buses, trains, and ferries.
