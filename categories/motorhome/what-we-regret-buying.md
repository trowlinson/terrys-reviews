## 🤦‍♂️ The Hall of Shame

We’re not saying these items are useless — just that they were useless *for us*. Maybe they’ll work for you. Maybe they’ll gather dust in your garage. Either way, here’s what didn’t make the cut.

---

### 🧼 Cleaning Gear That Never Cleaned

- **12V vacuum cleaner** – Weak suction, loud whine, and couldn’t handle crumbs.
- **Collapsible mop** – Collapsed more than it mopped.
- **Mini washing machine** – Took up space, didn’t clean clothes, and made us miss laundrettes.

---

### 🍳 Kitchen Gadgets That Stayed in the Cupboard

- **12V slow cooker** – Took hours to heat up, drained the battery, and made mush.
- **Stackable spice rack** – Looked great, rattled constantly, and spilled paprika everywhere.
- **Electric egg boiler** – Because pans exist.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech That Didn’t Deliver

- **Bluetooth tyre pressure monitor** – Lost connection, gave false readings, caused panic.
- **Magnetic phone mount** – Fell off every bump, flung phone into the footwell.
- **Solar shower bag** – Leaked, lukewarm, and awkward to hang.

---

### 🛏️ Comfort Items That Weren’t Comfortable

- **Inflatable mattress topper** – Slid around like a bouncy castle.
- **Travel pillows with memory foam** – Remembered the wrong shape.
- **Blackout blinds with suction cups** – Fell off at 3am, scared the dog.

---

### 🧃 Things We Thought Were Cool (But Weren’t)

- **12V blender** – Couldn’t blend a banana. Couldn’t even blend milk.
- **LED strip lighting with remote** – Lost the remote. Lights stuck on disco mode.
- **Portable espresso maker** – Required five steps, two hands, and a third degree in barista science.

## 💬 What We Learned

- If it’s fiddly, fragile, or fussy — it probably won’t get used.
- If it takes more effort than the manual method — skip it.
- If it sounds clever but you’ve never needed it before — wait until you do.
