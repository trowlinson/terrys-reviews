## 🔌 The Basics: 12V vs. 230V

- **12V system** – Powers lights, water pump, USB ports, fridge (on gas/12V), and some fans.
- **230V mains (hook-up)** – Powers sockets, microwave, kettle, and charges your leisure battery.
- **Inverter** – Converts 12V battery power to 230V for short-term use (e.g., laptop, camera).

💡 *Tip: Don’t run high-wattage appliances (like kettles or hairdryers) off your inverter unless it’s rated for it.*

## 🔋 Leisure Battery

- **What it does** – Stores power for your 12V system when not on hook-up.
- **Types** – Lead-acid, AGM, or lithium (more expensive but lighter and longer-lasting).
- **Capacity** – Measured in amp-hours (Ah). 100Ah is a common starting point.
- **Charging methods**:
  - Hook-up (via onboard charger)
  - Solar panel
  - Engine alternator (while driving)
  - Generator (less common, noisy)

## ☀️ Solar Power

- **Why it’s great** – Keeps your battery topped up off-grid.
- **Fixed vs. portable**:
  - *Fixed panels* – Roof-mounted, always charging when sunny.
  - *Portable panels* – Can be angled, moved with the sun, stored when not in use.
- **Controller** – MPPT is more efficient than PWM.
- **Size guide**:
  - 100W = light use (lights, USB)
  - 200W+ = moderate off-grid use
  - 300W+ = extended off-grid, fridge, laptops, etc.

## ⚡ Inverters

- **Pure sine wave** – Best for sensitive electronics (laptops, CPAP machines).
- **Modified sine wave** – Cheaper, but not ideal for all devices.
- **Size matters** – Match inverter wattage to your highest-draw device (e.g., 300W for a laptop, 1000W+ for a kettle).

---

## 🔌 Hook-Up Tips

- **Use a 25m cable** – Some pitches are awkwardly placed.
- **Check polarity** – Especially in Europe; use a tester plug.
- **Don’t overload** – Most sites offer 6A–16A. Avoid running multiple high-wattage devices at once.
- **Use a surge protector** – Protects your gear from dodgy site electrics.

---

## 🧪 Monitor & Manage

- **Battery monitor** – Shows voltage, amps, and charge level.
- **Smart chargers** – Maintain battery health when on hook-up.
- **Power audit** – Know what each device draws and how long you use it.

## 🧭 Off-Grid Readiness Checklist

- [ ] 100Ah+ leisure battery
- [ ] Solar panel (fixed or portable)
- [ ] Inverter (pure sine wave if using laptops)
- [ ] LED lighting (low draw)
- [ ] USB charging hub
- [ ] Efficient fridge (3-way or compressor)
- [ ] Water tank full, waste tank empty
- [ ] Apps for finding wild spots (Park4Night, Searchforsites)
