## 🧭 Know the Law (and the Grey Areas)

- **Wild camping is not strictly legal in England & Wales** — but tolerated in some places if done respectfully.
- **Scotland allows wild camping** under the Land Reform Act, but motorhomes are often excluded from this protection.
- **Always check local bylaws** — some councils prohibit overnight parking even in remote areas.
- **Use apps like Park4Night or Searchforsites** to find tolerated spots and read recent reviews.

## 🤫 Be Discreet

- **Arrive late, leave early** – Don’t linger or set up camp chairs and awnings.
- **Avoid busy or residential areas** – Stick to quiet lay-bys, forest edges, or remote car parks.
- **Don’t block access** – Leave room for farm vehicles, walkers, or emergency services.

---

## 🧼 Leave No Trace

- **Take all rubbish with you** – Including food scraps and grey water.
- **Use your onboard toilet** – Never relieve yourself outdoors.
- **Don’t drain waste tanks** – Not even “just water” — it’s still pollution.
- **Leave the spot cleaner than you found it** – Even if it wasn’t great to begin with.

---

## 🔇 Respect the Peace

- **No generators** – Especially at night or near homes.
- **Keep music and lights low** – You’re a guest in the landscape.
- **Avoid campfires or BBQs** – Unless clearly permitted and safe.

---

## 🐾 Respect Nature & Wildlife

- **Don’t disturb livestock or wildlife** – Especially during lambing or nesting seasons.
- **Keep dogs on leads** – Even in remote areas.
- **Stick to hardstanding or gravel** – Avoid damaging grass or soft ground.

---

## 💬 Be Friendly, But Not Flashy

- **A wave or smile goes a long way** – Especially if locals pass by.
- **Don’t set up camp furniture** – It signals “we’re staying” and draws attention.
- **If asked to move, do so politely** – Even if you think you’re in the right.
