- **Motorhome-friendly satnav or app** – Avoid low bridges and narrow lanes.
- **Camping and Caravanning Club membership** – Access to CLs and discounts.
- **Route planner** – Know your fuel stops, pitch times, and backup sites.

## 🛣️ Driving in the UK

- **Watch for width restrictions** – Especially in villages and coastal roads.
- **Know your weight limits** – Some bridges and lanes have strict limits.
- **Use lay-bys wisely** – Great for breaks, not for overnighting.
- **Be courteous** – Pull over to let faster traffic pass when safe.
