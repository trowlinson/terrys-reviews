## 🚐 Start with Your Travel Style

Before you even look at models, ask yourself:

- **Who’s travelling?** Solo, couple, family, pets?
- **Trip length?** Weekend breaks or months on the road?
- **Where will you stay?** Club sites, CLs, wild camping?
- **How confident are you driving?** A 6m panel van is very different from an 8m coachbuilt.

Your answers shape everything — from layout to payload.

## 🧱 Types of Motorhomes in the UK

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Campervan** | Compact, often VW-style or panel van conversions | City breaks, solo/couple travel |
| **Coachbuilt (C-Class)** | Cab-over design, more space, fixed beds | Families, longer trips |
| **A-Class** | Fully integrated cab, luxury feel | Full-timers, comfort seekers |
| **Van Conversion** | Stealthy, agile, often DIY or semi-custom | Rural touring, minimalists |

## 💸 Budgeting Beyond the Purchase Price

Factor in:

- **Insurance** – varies by age, size, and storage
- **Road tax** – based on weight and emissions
- **MOT & servicing** – especially for older vehicles
- **Storage** – if you can’t park it at home
- **Upgrades** – solar, awnings, levelling ramps, etc.

💡 *Tip: Set a firm upper limit and stick to it — the extras add up fast.*

## 🛏️ Layout & Features to Think About

- **Sleeping:** Fixed bed vs. make-up bed? Island bed or transverse?
- **Kitchen:** Do you need an oven, or just a hob and grill?
- **Bathroom:** Full washroom, wet room, or porta-loo only?
- **Storage:** Garage space, lockers, payload capacity?
- **Power:** Hook-up only, or do you need solar and leisure batteries?

---

## 🧪 Learn from Experience

- **Hire before you buy** — try different layouts and sizes
- **Talk to owners** — forums, rallies, or campsite chats
- **Keep a “must-have” and “nice-to-have” list**
- **Be honest about your habits** — do you really need a microwave?

## 🧰 What You *Think* You Need vs. What You *Actually* Use

We’ve all bought the collapsible washing line that never left the boot. Or the 12V blender that couldn’t blend a banana. That’s part of the fun.

Start simple. You’ll learn fast what matters most — and what’s just clutter.
