## 🕰️ Thinking About It

- **Start a wishlist** – What kind of trips do you imagine? Who’s coming? What comforts matter?
- **Browse YouTube & forums** – Watch van tours, campsite reviews, and “what we wish we’d known” videos.
- **Join a Facebook group** – Ask questions, read real-world advice, and see what others are buying.

---

## 🧪 Try Before You Buy

- **Hire a motorhome** – Test different layouts, sizes, and features.
- **Take notes** – What worked? What annoyed you? What would you change?

## 🧠 Research Phase

- **Set a budget** – Include insurance, road tax, servicing, and gear.
- **Learn the types** – Campervan, coachbuilt, A-class, van conversion — what suits your style?
- **Visit dealers & shows** – Sit in different models, ask questions, compare layouts.

---

## 📝 Shortlist & Viewings

- **Make a checklist** – Fixed bed? Garage? Solar? Payload?
- **View second-hand options** – Ask about service history, damp checks, MOTs.
- **Don’t rush** – The right van will come. The wrong one will haunt you.

---

## 💸 Purchase & Prep

- **Negotiate** – Dealers often have wiggle room, especially off-season.
- **Insure & register** – Shop around for quotes and breakdown cover.
- **Stock up (sensibly)** – Essentials first: levelling ramps, hookup cable, toilet chemicals.

---

## 🚐 First Trips

- **Stay local** – Test everything close to home.
- **Keep a log** – What you used, what you didn’t, what you forgot.
- **Tweak your setup** – Add solar, swap bedding, reorganise storage.

---

## 🔁 Reflect & Refine

- **Update your gear list** – What’s essential, what’s cool, what’s clutter?
- **Share your story** – Help others by sharing your wins and fails.
- **Plan your next adventure** – France, Scotland, Cornwall… the road is yours.
