## The Television

There are a lot of arguments when it comes to televisions and motorhomes. Some people say they should be banned, others wouldn't be without them. I'm not here to judge either way, I am however here to suggest ways to enjoy a bit of telly on those dark cold evenings - and the hot, sultry evenings too - whatever floats your boat.

There are two main ways to connect a television to transmissions:
    a TV aerial that is raised on the roof of the motorhome, or
    via the internet

Personally, I like the internet route because it gives you more choice and allows you to watch streaming service providers. Both the internet connections and streaming service providers are the subject of a different page (coming soon)

Another thing that an internet-connected television gives you is an advantage of size. You don't need a traditional television with a receiver and can get what is commonly referred to as a 'smart monitor'. A smart monitor is a computer monitor with apps installed. Apps being applications like Netflix, BBC iPlayer (of course you have a licence), Prime Videos, Disney+, ITVX, etc. What you can't do is connect a standard television aerial. I installed one of these smart monitors:

Really good price at Amazon at the moment with the Black Friday special: 

- [Smart Monitor M5](https://amzn.to/4rkrEbV)

I used a bracket that let's you easily remove the TV and put it away safely for when you are on the move, one of these: 

- [QUAD ARM TV BRACKET QUICK RELEASE](https://visionplus.co.uk/product/vp-tv-wall-bracket-quad-arm-quick-release/)

It gives plenty of options for placement but can be a bit saggy with the weight of that TV/monitor but it works ok.
