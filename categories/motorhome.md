## 🚐 Welcome to the Motorhome Hub

This is where we get real about motorhome travel — the good, the bad, and the gloriously unexpected. Whether you’re planning your first trip or you’ve been living on the road for years, this space is for sharing what worked, what didn’t, and what we wish we’d known sooner.

We’ve toured France and the UK, stayed at stunning campsites and regrettable car parks, bought gear we never used, and discovered a few essentials we wouldn’t travel without. Here, you’ll find honest reviews, practical tips, and stories from the road — including the occasional rant about dodgy satnavs or overpriced campsite showers.
