# Contribute a Review

We love hearing from fellow travellers and gear enthusiasts. Whether it’s a campsite you loved, a motorhome you’ve tested, or a piece of kit that made your journey smoother — your insights help others make better decisions.

## What to Include

- **Title of your review**  
- **Location or product name**  
- **Your experience** — what worked, what didn’t  
- **Tips for others** — packing, planning, or navigating  
- **Photos** (optional but welcome)

## Submit Your Review

We use Google Forms to make it easy for anyone to contribute. Just fill out the form below — no login or technical knowledge required.

<div id="form-wrapper">
  <iframe id="review-form"
    src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCfGn04GrT2iYgEuXJo8y7NQo75TcRut4EgqMaSDJ_wo2I8g/viewform?embedded=true"
    width="100%" height="1200" frameborder="0">Loading…</iframe>
</div>

<script>
  const formFrame = document.getElementById('review-form');
  formFrame.addEventListener('load', () => {
    // When the form reloads after submission, scroll to the wrapper
    document.getElementById('contribute-a-review').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  });
</script>
